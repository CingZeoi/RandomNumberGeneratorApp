## Cirong Random Number Generator (for Android)

So, the world may be no need one more random number generator for Android.

But I always want to try, can I use my favorite tools (C# and .NET) to build one real native Android app... so, it is here now. This small app is my experiment's result.

Hope you can feel it useful, or if not, a little interesting is also good!

### What function it has? üéÅ

Its function is simple, very direct, like its name. Also have some small careful functions.

*   **Generate Numbers:** Can quickly make many random numbers in any range you give.
*   **Have Two Modes:** You can choose allow duplicate numbers (very free way) or must be unique (for person who like clean).
*   **Can Sort the Result:** You can one-click change the order: Random order, Small to Big, Big to Small.
*   **Copy is Convenient:** Can take one number, or copy all numbers. The format is good, like `[42, 1, 99, 15]`.

### The Story Behind

This is my first time try to use .net write Android app. Before, I have use Java to do development.

As a C# developer, my heart has a question. Can I build one smooth, very fast, almost 100% native Android app and no need to write Kotlin or Java? What feeling is it?

This project is my answer. It is all use **.NET 8 and c# to make for Android**.

Maybe you can find bugs, or some design is not so good. Sometimes you will think, "...why he do like this?" This is normal! My main purpose is to try, to do experiment, and share this thing.

### We Make This Thing Better, Together!

Really. This is only my hobby project. My level is limited. Open-source's best thing is we study together.

*   **You find a bug?** Very good! (OK, not very good, but you understand my meaning). Please [open one issue](https://github.com/CingZeoi/RandomNumberGeneratorApp/issues).
*   **Have a wacky idea for a feature?** I'm all ears. Let's discuss it!

My hope is that this can be a small playground for anyone interested in exploring the world of C# and .NET on Android.

### For the Tinkerers üõ†Ô∏è

Do you want to build it on your computer? Is very simple.

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Use **Visual Studio 2022** to open the solution (you must install .NET for Android workload, it has the needed SDK and component).
3.  Connect your Android phone or open an emulator.
4.  Press F5, then you can see the magic. (Or maybe, you see compiler tell me some error I forget).
